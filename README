This is a Maven project which is used as template when creating a unit test for Activiti.

Rules to reproduce activiti issue:
1. Use limited set of dependencies. Allowed dependencies are only from org.activiti group and from currently used dependencies in the unit test project template.
2. Use the minimal possible process model to reproduce the issue.
3. Issue must be reproducible in one standard jUnit test. (without any further configurations, need to manually perform any action)
4. The jUnit test must clearly define what is expected behavior and what is the issue.
5. The test execution has to provide the result in 5 minutes. In the case of long running processes you can use activiti virtual time support.
6. jUnit test must not use experimental and deprecated activiti features.
7. The test must be able to be executed automatically from the mvn command line interface. ('mvn test')
